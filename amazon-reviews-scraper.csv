I saw what appeared to be directions saying the easy install clip could easily slide on most types types of wipers, and a QR code to watch a video if I found the task too challenging.

I slid the wipers on, and it was easy and quick. Very cool design! I thought my task was complete. 200 miles later, I realized I made mistake of forgetting to remove the protective plastic cover.

You are probably assuming I am just an idiot - which might be true. However, every wiper blade I have bought in my life has had no cover, or a cheap, clear plastic cover that went around the blade. This cover is a soft, hoity toity yellow plastic. At first, I did think it was a removable cover, but I thoroughly inspected it to make sure. After feeling the quality of the material, and noticing that there is a special groove cut into the blade that this insert slides into, I thought, ""Given this level of care and craftsmanship, it is surely an integral part of the blade - it must be where the Rain-X power comes from! The distinctive yellow color is telling me that this is not just something to be thrown away!""

I sprayed wiper fluid on my windshield, with covers intact, and it worked! It wasn't an amazing clean, but was about as good as my old blade I replaced. I guess the Rain-X fluid must have washed off the blade a bit and landed on the windshield enough to give me some visibility. I have driven for the better part of a week, including through a rain storm, and these damn covers did not fall off, and allowed me to see.

To add insult to injury, when I finally pulled off the covers, the hidden part recessed within the body of the wiper blade read ""remove cover before using"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

They hug your windshield glass for a total and clean wipe, unlike the cheap ridged ones that leave streaks across your windshield. Depending on your amount of driving, they will last a year or two. If you would like to extend their life, Just take a paper towel with vinegar and clean the black grime buildup, and they will last even longer. Once I tried these, there is no way I will go back to regular wipe blades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

The wipers have some sort of product on them that causes the water to bead up and it makes it so you barely need to use the wipers.

If I could change one thing, I'd make the rectangular part of the wiper, where it attaches, smaller. It doesn't obstruct my vision but I notice it while I'm driving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

Sometimes size 9 so I can add a Dr Scholl arch insole.  I ordered these Crocs in two different sizes so I could try them and return the size that didn’t work. The size women’s 9 was too large/loose. The size women’s 8 fit me best, but not perfect.  2) The right shoe is somewhat larger & looser than the left, and the heel strap is longer.  3) I tried inserting a Dr Scholl insole in these Crocs. It did make the shoes more snug on my feet, and added arch support.  The insoles stayed in place.  But, it just felt wrong to put an insole in a Croc shoe since I bought these for orthopedic comfort & support, so I removed them.  4) My husband also just ordered these exact Crocs from Amazon in size Men's 11.  He normally wears a size 10.5 or 11 shoe. They fit him okay, but they are somewhat loose on his narrow feet and he ends up walking duck-footed, with his toes pointed outward, to keep them from slipping.

COMFORT: 1) After reading A LOT of reviews, I concluded that the comfort of Crocs are unique to each person. People with wider feet seem to really love them. People with foot or back problems love them. People with narrower feet aren’t usually impressed by them.  2) I sit & stand at my desk all day and these shoes are more comfortable than flip flops, but not as comfortable as high quality sneakers.  3) I have high arches and these shoes are tolerable, but don’t really offer much arch support.  Perhaps my feet will eventually mold to the rubber – time will tell.  4) These Crocs have a slight cushioned insole. They are not hard plastic, and the insole has a little bit of cushy give when I take a step.  5) When wearing these shoes for extended periods, I notice pain in the ball of my feet - metatarsals.  6) The little nubs inside these shoes are soft enough that they don’t bother me or hurt my feet. That says a lot because I have very sensitive feet!  7) I find these shoes to be more comfortable and slip less when I wear them with socks.  8) I have a knock-off brand of Crocs with removeable orthopedic insoles. Those were initially comfortable on my feet, but the longer I wore them the more my feet hurt. The knock-off brand cost MORE than these Crocs ($33 vs $26).

LOOKS + COLOR: 1) Well, what can I really say here except I really didn’t buy these for looks. They look like wide orthopedic shoes.  Oh yeah, that’s because they are!  Comfort overruled style in my case.  2) I bought some cute white flower charms on Amazon and that made my Crocs look more feminine and added a little something that was needed.  3) I ordered these in the color CHOCOLATE because I wanted a neutral color that didn’t draw attention to my huge orthopedic shoes. In the listing photo they look kind of sparkly, but they aren’t. They are a light, soft brown, almost a taupe color.  Later, IF this shoe style grows on me (remember, I’m a newbie Crock wearer) I may try some other fun colors like pink or red.

OTHER + GOOD TO KNOW + TIPS:  1) As other reviewers mention, these shoes squeak as you walk. Each step is “squeak, squeak, squeak…”.  2) In my opinion, Crocs are not ideal for narrow feet like mine. The shoes feel loose and I had them slip off while walking, which could be hazardous. I would not walk in these shoes for long distances or on uneven ground or on steps.  3) I heard that Crocs can be loosened or tightened using a blow dryer or in a clothes dryer.  I tried to tighten mine using a blow dryer on high heat, held 6 inches away, then let cool.  I was hoping the material would slightly shrink, especially the heel strap which is too loose.  Unfortunately, this heat method did not work for me. *If you try this, USE CAUTION so you don't ruin your shoes!  4) I read many reviews where people said their Crocs shrunk or warped when left out in the sun or in a hot vehicle , so keep that in mind.  5) The holes in the plastic help ventilate enough that my feet don’t get super hot. Yes, my feet sweat a little in these shoes. There is a slight foot odor when wearing without socks. That is to be expected with rubber shoes.  6) I prefer to wear these shoes with socks because it helps with sweating and my feet don’t slip as much.  7) The tag on these shoes says Made in China. The bottom of the shoe is imprinted with Made in China. They have a tag that warns about riding on escalators and holding children’s hands at all times. I would never wear these on an escalator, but there must be some reason they include this tag – probably because of known issues of the rubber soles getting stuck on escalators.  8) I have no idea if these are “authentic” Crocs because this is my first pair and I have nothing to compare to.  I checked the official Crocs’ website and the shoes I received from Amazon look exactly like those on Crocs’ website.  9) At the time of this review, I paid $26 for these Crocs on Amazon.  This same style on the official Crocs’ website is priced much higher at $49. Amazon offers a lot more color options than Crocs’ website.  10) I found where Amazon sells a slightly different style of Croc brand shoes that I might try “Crocs Unisex-Adult All Terrain Clogs with Adjustable Heel Strap”.  The adjustable heel strap may help in keeping my feet from sliding around. That style is a lot pricier at $41.

IN CONCLUSION: As a newbie Croc wearer, I am not totally convinced these shoes live up to all the hype and amazing reviews I read.  Like I said, I don’t think these are ideal for my narrow feet. I don’t feel safe wearing these outside my house because my feet slip in them so much.  I will most likely wear these inside my house, inside my RV or around the campsite.  PS- I am really disappointed that these didn’t meet all my expectations, and I am envious of all the people who rave about these shoes.

I paid full price for these Crocs and was not compensated in any way for this review. I hope you found it helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

They're basically an air-conditioned piece of heaven for your feet. It's as if Michael Jordan, John Daly, and Jesus Christ Him/Herself got together and created the ultimate ""do anything, anytime, anywhere in whatever weather shoe"". That's what these puppies are. I can without a doubt say that your dogs will not be barkin' after wearing these magnificent pieces of pure genius.

With that being said, you should consider shifting these babies into sports mode more often than not. Last night, as I was walking up my stairs (which by the way, felt like the stairway to heaven in these majestical pieces of art), the grip (which is also incredible under any condition) was too much for my steps and I slipped right out of them. As I tumbled down the stairs, I couldn't help but think, this is probably what Samael felt like when Michael the Arch Angel had thrown him out of heaven. As I desperately tried to grasp anything in sight, like Samael tried to grab Michael, all I could see were my two, beautiful blue crocs planted on the stairs. After my terrifying descent down this stairway to heaven, I realized I had succumbed to some minor injuries, including a sprained ankle and bruised forearm. As I sat at the bottom of these godforsaken steps, my stunning blue crocs, still firmly positioned on the steps, stared at me in a way that I can only describe as mosses seeing the burning bush. As I gazed further into the blue, the sport mode straps said nothing, but also everything all at once.  It was truly a lesson I will never forget.

So that's what brings me here today. Don't be like me. If ever in doubt, flip these bad boys into sport mode and march on solider.","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

Still wear them when mowing. Always recommend this product. Don't like turning the big 51. Because to me the Big business is taking advantage of us in price gouging.

Living on a limited budget I make sure to just spend a little bit more to get awesome stuff. You kinda get what you pay for. Parents taught me that. Do your research, but don't over analyze it. People get to picky. Either try one or move on.

These are my favorite shoes. Especially since I've become a recipient of Social Security Disability. It's not my choice but my health issues. Plus was cursed with flat and wide feet. Could be a blessing. That's my opinion.

So order this product for everyone in your family and friends. You'd be a great friend to buy for others. When you share and show great kindness it will come full circle.

Bought two pairs of this product. Because of 51st birthday. Anyhow they're AWESOME AND DEPENDABLE.

I got a Size 8 White color.

CLEANING: I was hesitant to buy white due to the possibility of getting dirty but took chances and got it. I have zero regrets — I have worn them a handful of times, but even when stained a bit, it was a breeze to clean by wiping down with a wash cloth, water, and soap (if need be).

SIZING: If you are in between sizes, I recommend sizing down. I am an 8 and ordered 9 but they were too big, so I had to get an 8 which was much better.

COMFORTABILITY AND USE: I wear these to the gym and they are comfortable and durable even during intense rotors including weight lifting.

PRICING: I got mine around $32 in July. As I’m making this review in August they are almost $50. I like them a lot as you can’t compare the quality to other clog knockoffs.

The more sophisticated choice. 😁","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2023","After all these years, (74) this is the first pair of Croc’s that I’ve ever purchased. I’ve tried plastic type shoes in the past that always made my feet feel too warm and sweaty, so I stayed away from these. But I read an article the other day about how the Croc brand was becoming more popular, given a boost by Covid and so many people working from home or just hanging out at home more and buying them. So I took a chance and ordered these Classic Navy Crocs.

When the package arrived, I couldn’t believe how unbelievably light in weight they are. I ordered a size 9 which is pretty much what I wear these days. They looked big and clunky and my toe comes quite a ways from the top, but the fit is actually perfect. I thought they would fall off when I walked, but that is not a problem at all. They stay on whether I flip the strap up, or down around the back of my heels. I have never had them slip off so far. When the strap is down around my heel, it fits loosely, but I have to use my other foot or hand to move it down to remove them. When I put it up over the top, I can slip them on and off easier, but they still don’t come off when I’m walking. Maybe that’s due to the little slightly raised dots all over the inside footbed. Just enough to keep my feet from slipping, but not enough to be uncomfortable. There is only the slightest arch support although I tried a pair of thin shoe pads which gave them some cush, a little support, and are pretty much invisible. But they did make my feet sweat a little due to the slightly snugger fit.

Although there isn’t much cush to them, they don’t feel real hard either. We have tile floors throughout most of our downstairs and they aren’t quite as hard as walking on the floor. I slip them on first thing in the morning, so I guess they are comfortable in their own way. I go barefoot indoors most of the summer anyway, so it isn’t really an issue. These are like going  barefoot with the advantage of protecting the sole of your foot if you step on prickly things. Or in the dog poop on the sidewalk that you didn’t notice. Speaking of dog poop, tyou can use as much soap and water on these as you want without harming them and they air dry in minutes or dry off with a towel or paper towel instantly.

They certainly are ugly looking, but they grow on you. Sort of like a Bulldog or Persian cat. Within a short while you grow to love them. In fact, I bought a second pair of classic light tie dye Crocs which my Amazon driver delivered yesterday. OMG, light, bright and colorful! Just the thing an old hippie like me could fall in love with! Even my husband said he liked them. (Said he didn’t think he would ever wear anything like that, but he commented on them several times throughout the day.) They even make a pair of Jimmy Buffet beach Crocs with lime, umbrella, ice cubes and even the “lost shaker of salt” Jibbitz. Very cool for a Parrothead, but can’t imagine those accessories that look like they could be dog toys staying on the Crocs!

I’ve only had these around a week, so I can’t say how long they’ll last, but they feel sturdy and well made in spite of their incredible lightness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

My husband found his feet had ""shifted"" during the work-from-home-mandate, with slippers becoming his go-to. His narrow feet spread.

I waited a while to review because I wanted to really try them out to see what all of the hype was about.

I love the color, they look exactly as they do in the images. They are light weight, I barely feel like I’m wearing shoes. They are pretty true to size, I would say if you wear a half size, go down not up. At first I thought they were uncomfortable because I have high arches. After some wear, the foam breaks down in all of the right places and you feel support where you need it.

100% recommend!! I want allll of the colors now! Get a few that match with your outfits well. I’m on my feet all day -vet clinic- for work and I won’t go back to any other shoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Crocs-Unisex-Classic-Black-Women/product-reviews/B0014C2NBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

At first, when they began popping up I didn’t understand why they were so popular, and why everyone had them. But a few months ago, I tried a friend’s on, and it was great! I had understood that chefs and cooks had used them for a long time due to comfort, but never understood why; when I tried them on I finally understood. Although being, in my opinion, very ugly, they are extremely comfortable and practical for daily use; they clean and slip on easily. The extra material on the heel is what makes them extremely cushy and snug. Overall, they are a great buy for anyone looking for a functional, soft pair of shoes (although not very pretty).","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Crocs-Unisex-Classic-Black-Women/product-reviews/B0014C2NBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

Works great in any wet situation!","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2023","Like many, I don't wear them as a style choice. But they are superb for any wet location or chores that involve a lot of water, like pressure washing decks, fences, and houses. The size is true to form and I didn't know they even made them in my size (most shoe brands don't make or at least advertise a 15), or I'd have bought them sooner.

I particularly like how easy they are to spray clean, and leave to dry. In still air, they are dry in a couple hours. With a fan, minutes. Portable, and great for the beach as well! The reason I like them better than flip flops at the beach is that they are structurally more sound which, for older folks, makes it less likely to turn an ankle on some forgiving sand or a slippery rock. Listen, I'm not crazy about their shape or visual design, but they do the job when you need them to with a lot of durabilty. Would buy again, but I can't see ever needing to.

The Croslite material used in the construction of these clogs is a game-changer. It's not only soft and comfortable but also water-resistant and easy to clean. I can confidently wear them in wet environments or simply toss them in the washing machine to freshen them up—convenience at its finest.

Another fantastic feature of the Classic Clog is its slip-on style. The adjustable heel strap allows for a secure fit and added stability. Whether I choose to wear them with the strap behind my heel or flipped forward for a relaxed fit, they stay firmly in place throughout the day.

The versatility of these clogs is a major selling point. They are unisex and come in a wide range of colors and patterns, allowing everyone to find their perfect match. They are also available in a variety of sizes, ensuring a comfortable fit for both adults and children.

Some say they are ugly, but the rest of us silently laugh as we enjoy the ease and comfort these give.

I like that they work in any conditions.  I especially wear them when working in the pig pen. I step in interesting things and no matter how good your boots are something ultimately makes it inside,  which is the worst.  With these I can get a hose and just clean things off. There is almost no job around my property I haven't used them for. The only problem is sticker weeds sometimes.  The holes in the front don't give much protection there.  But they also don't collect burrs and other things that regular shoes do.

My kids all wear them and they like to put those charms on them.  I've seen lights for them and even the bull anatomy thing that you see on some trailer hitches.  I guess if that is what you have to do to feel manly,  then go for it.

(And I’ve owned a bunch)","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023","I’ve been buying Kindles every since the second model came out way back in 2009 or so. The Kindle is a marvelous invention that got me reading again and reading 3-4 times as much as I ever did with paper books. I have no romantic notions about paper and glue anymore.

I’d go as far as saying the Kindle is arguably the most underrated invention of the early 21st century. But you’re here for the review, so…

As for why I like THIS Kindle so much. Well, I love the fact that all of the most important features have finally trickled down to the base model. I could afford to buy any Kindle I want of course, and I usually buy one of the middle or higher end Kindles. This one was actually replacing an older Paperwhite.

The fact that all the best features are present on the base model now makes me feel better about Kindles and Amazon in general honestly. My first Kindle was $399, so I love the fact that this one is so affordable and within reach of a lot more people now.

This Kindle also gets the fastest SoC (microprocessor) that the newest Kindles have. That means it’s as fast, or faster than any of the Kindle models.

It’s finally got a generous amount of memory for anyone with anything but the biggest book collection. I’ll never fill it up I’m sure.

It’s even got the higher dpi (resolution) Paperwhite screen now, so you’re no longer penalized with pixelated fonts or less contrast for buying the entry level model and I LOVE that.

One of my favorite feature though is that it’s super small and light, which I really love. It’s the smallest, lightest, most pocketable Kindle there’s ever been. That’s a nice feature that makes you more likely to take it with you everywhere.

The only things you’re really giving up versus a Paperwhite that I know of are the extra LEDs (I don’t miss them a bit, backlighting is more than enough) and the warmer color backlighting option (nice to have, but I can definitely live without it).

This model also has a bit less battery life than the Paperwhite (maybe 15-20% less?) But it’s still a Kindle, which means it will last longer than any other device you own. I doubt the battery life will be a complaint from many.

The final feature it’s missing is actually a PLUS to me. It’s the fact that the screen is recessed. I actually prefer that (I can’t be the only one). I like being able to tell by touch precisely where the screen begins. It makes it easier to avoid touching the screen accidentally and I just think it looks better to be honest.

The only feature I WISH it had is PAGE TURN BUTTONS. I have no idea WHY Amazon has limited them to only the Oasis models. Other eInk book manufacturers like Kobo managed to find a way to include page turn buttons on nearly every model. Come on, Amazon.

I had been planning on buying an Oasis for several years, specifically to get the page turn buttons. But I simply got tired of WAITING for Amazon to make an Oasis with USB-C charging already and update the hardware to match the newer models.

I finally gave up on waiting for a USB-C Oasis after I read rave reviews of the new base model and Prime Day rolled around with a price drop on it.

I’m super satisfied with it though. Lack of buttons aside, I think it’s my favorite Kindle yet due to the exceptional value, ultra-pocketable size and feature set.

This model has everything I think most people really need and want in a Kindle at a very fair price (especially when you buy it during Prime Days like I did!).

I also really appreciate the opportunity to buy a Kindle in a color other than black or white for a change. The Denim Blue is cool and different and that’s a feature you cannot get in ANY other Kindle model. Amazon should consider making a few more color choices here and there. I guarantee it would juice up sales.

If they just added some sturdy page turn buttons to this, a physical switch to disable the touch screen, the “warm” backlighting option and gave it a bigger battery that’s designed to be easily replaced, it would be the PERFECT Kindle for me.

That and I wish Amazon would give us greater control over our Home Screen. I just want a simple list of folders or my collections. I don’t want to see “suggestions” or any eye candy marketing fluff. Minor complaint though.

All-in-all I think when you take price into consideration, this is the BEST KINDLE Amazon has ever made, hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

Good choice. A few things to note about this.

The ads are not pop ups. I know some dead tree fans would have you believe, right in the middle of a tense scene, an ad will interrupt the page. That’s not how this works. What happens is, when you put the device in sleep mode, rather than say the cover or the portrait of a famous author, you see an ad. If you use the physical cover to turn on and off the device, you won’t see much if any of the ads.  And yes, you can dog ear a page.

I have no idea why memes keep popping up to say you can’t. Actually, the things you can do with a print book that you can’t with a Kindle book are: Donate them to the library if the library starts taking books again, give used copies to a friend, sell used copies, have a bookmark accidentally fall out, and use them for, well, kindling. Kindle can do everything else. Things you can do on a Kindle and not a print book are: read in the dark, search for text, carry dozens of books in your pocket, create notes of virtually unlimited size (you run out of room in the margin of a print book), pick up a new book nearly anywhere, anytime, and instantly convert your entire library to large print.

Most library systems can send any borrowed e-book directly to your Kindle. And your place and notes are stored in case you borrow the book again or buy a copy. You don’t get that with print.

Amazon recently improved their send to Kindle features with a drag and drop web page that makes moving your own documents to the device extremely simple.

This comes with a USB-C cable, but not a charger (aka wall wort) so if you don’t have one lying around (I think the expectation is most of us do) you will need to pick one up.

16 gig might not sound like a lot, but most books fall under 2K.  I’ve seen public libraries (I’m looking at you, Florida) with fewer books than this can hold. Audible eats the memory a bit more, but I find this to be more than enough.

You don’t get cellular connectivity with this, but that’s only with the premium Oasis line now. Scribe even missed out on that. I find it convenient, but I understand wifi is ubiquitous enough these days it’s not a big deal for most users. I have an annoying habit of finishing a book on the crosstown bus, then needing the next in the series. Yes, the cell phone tether works. No, that’s not as convenient as built-in cellular.
It has fewer LEDs than most, but that’s not a big deal. Four lets you read in the dark. The scribe has 35. Guys, it’s an e-reader, not a disco, no one needs that many separate lights on that small a device. The absence of a warm light and auto adjusting lights are a bigger issue here. The warm light makes a big difference when you’re reading before bed.

It doesn’t have the waterproofing, which I thought was a bigger deal when that first came out, but in all the time since I’ve yet to (knock wood) get a Kindle wet. It’s a nice to have, not a have to have.

The size can throw people at first. The screen approximates two things – an index card turned portrait and a mass market paperback page. The occasional “ghosting” mirrors the see-through element of the cheaper mass market paperbacks, except on the device it refreshes quickly, and the ghosting goes away.

There were some studies done that suggest memory is improved from reading from print rather than e-book. I want to point out a few issues and cite my own experience. First, all the studies I could find cite pop ups and other distractions as the primary issue. That is, the test is on a general-purpose tablet, not a single purpose e-reader. When they either do a study on an actual e-reader or compare with pop ups on the tablet vs someone coming over just as often and tossing brochures on their print book I’ll believe it. Unless all factors are equal, the study is inherently flawed. To my experience, my ability to absorb and either use the information (if it’s non-fiction) or retain it over time (if it’s fiction) is nearly identical in both, with the slight advantage of the e-book being able to search back in the text for prior information. It drives me nuts when a quote resurfaces in a print book, and I can’t find the prior mention again. Or when I need to find a code snippet in a shelf full of computer books rather than just search on device and have it in seconds.

So, if you’re comfortable with the mass market paperback format, the size, the quality, then this is a huge step up. If you want to lay your hands on information quickly, then this is a huge step up.
If you want portability, then this is a huge step up. I just had to help an elderly woman move into assisted living and the loss of space cost her nearly all of her much-loved library. I find it comforting that nearly all of mine fits in my purse. No more culling the library for space, then finding you need to buy a new copy. If you delete an e-book from your Kindle, you can download it again for free. I remember, in the dark days before the Kindle was invented, being stuck on a flight from Arizona to New York with nothing to read but the most misogynistic, worst written mystery novel I’d ever encountered. If I had a Kindle, I’d have had at least a dozen better choices at hand, not to mention rereads.

The downside here is twofold. First, Dune and The Great Gatsby look the same size on the reader, so it’s hard to eyeball that one is a super-fast read and the other a meaty novel. It’s also a little too easy to build up a massive TBR pile, given it takes no physical space, the device memory is ample, and Amazon keeps offering free books to Prime members every month, sometimes more than one, and a crazy number of deeply discounted books Prime or not.

If you are concerned about the environment, then this is a matter of economics of scale. On the last study I checked, the magic number was 20. At 20 books the manufacture and transport impact of the e-reader ties the impact of manufacturing and transporting print books. At 21 and beyond, the e-reader has almost no further impact as compared to the printing and transporting of physical books. E-readers have boasted substantial improvements in reducing their carbon footprint since that study, but I can find no more recent information. Even at 20, the worst number, it’s clear that e-readers are a pure win for the environment.

It’s a great device. If you want to go with this one as the entry level, you won’t be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

W. Webb","Small, easier to carry, light and a pleasure to read!","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023","I seldom write reviews on items I purchase, unless there is something really outstanding to talk about. This Kindle falls into that category. First, let me say that I have owned every iteration of Kindle starting with Gen 2. My wife gave me one for Christmas in 2009. It was love at first read. I have not read a conventional book since that day, but I have read over 2,000 books in the Kindle edition since then. My favorite Kindle up to now was the early Oasis with the duel battery setup. It was small, light, and had good storage, a decent display and was a joy to read. Unfortunately, it now is old, well used, no longer updatable and has a weak cover battery. The later Oasis with a 7” screen is a fine Kindle with many minor upgrades, but it is heavier, much more cumbersome to use while reading in bed, and it hurts my face when I fall asleep while reading and drop it on my nose.

When I saw this Kindle advertised in a Prime Day ad as the smallest, lightest Kindle yet, at an awesome price, I just had to have one. I had the previous iteration of this model and it didn’t impress my all that much. My wife still has one and she doesn’t use it either. It’s not a bad device, it’s just clunky. I gave mine away to a friend who had an earlier Kindle that was way beyond its useful life. This new Gen 11 2022 Kindle has a lot to like. It has many minor upgrades that add up to a great value. It is both smaller and lighter than the previous generation. It has a better display, more storage, and is lighter and thinner, making it a pleasure to read in bed. (No more sore noses…) Now that I’ve had a chance to evaluate this device, it is my opinion that it is worth the money at the regular price, and a flat out steal at the Prime Day discount. Different folks have different preferences when looking at an eReader, but to me, they hit one out of the park with this model! Thank you, Amazon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

My first day using it, this is my opinion:
 1) The lock screen ads aren't a nuisance at all.  As soon as you swipe up, they're gone and they don't interfere with your reading experience.
2) The screen has white with black text and night mode, which are both sufficient for a smooth reading experience.  There is no glare at all on the screen and the text is at a comfortable size to read.
3) The device charges quickly.  When it arrived, it was at 58% and within an hour or two, the battery was fully charged using the provided USB cable and my laptop.
4) The setup was super easy and took less than 5 minutes.  I would recommend getting the Kindle app set up on your phone prior to receiving the device because it just saved so much of the usual setup BS that you will often encounter with new devices.  It connected almost immediately and all my books were right at my fingertips.

I saw a couple of complaints from other reviewers about not having continuous scrolling, but to me it's not an issue -- you just tap left or right to go to the previous page or the next one.  I also saw a complaint about it having a bezel, but to me it doesn't detract from the look of the device at all.

Overall, I have zero complaints about this device and would highly recommend it!  I also appreciate how you can pick up where you left off when reading.  It is lightweight and the screen is a sufficient size for reading, without being too bulky.  I also like how a PIN can be added for security.

10/10 would recommend this Kindle device and will probably not want to read on a tablet again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

It is indeed more comfortable in the hand. I use this daily and am content.
However, there are  things that do not live up to what this kindle is supposedly capable of:
1. It will never download my whole library. When it gets too many books on it, my only choice is to do a factory reset.*
The first sign of trouble is when I cannot download the book from the kindle device. Then I have to go to My Content and Devices on my Amazon account web page to send the book to kindle. At some point,  it cannot deliver a book.
Then the helpful tech support people will tell you to do a factory reset. You will erase all content, of course, and then it will need to do any upgrades from 2022 (in my case) when it was first released.
Note: I've never gotten 1,000 books on any kindle without this happening
2. If you have a lot of books, it is not able to organize your books by series. The apps on my iPhone and iPad organize them fine, but no longer on my kindle device.
What does this mean?
Don't spend extra money getting more storage. I never came close to using the 32Gb on the Oasis, and I still have over 11Gb free on this kindle. It doesn't matter: I will have to perform a factory reset long before I come close.

Features are very minimal, but that's perfectly fine for me.

As I've seen on other reviews, there's a delay between input and response, but that's to be expected with e-ink, as the screen has to refresh to change the image.

I saw one review that mentioned battery life at 50% after only 12 hours. I'd like to address this, as I thought I had the same issue at one point. I took my reader to work after using it for a few days and saw 48%, which I assumed was the battery level. It wasn't. It was how far I'd gotten in the book I was reading. My battery was at 65% when realized my goof and checked the next morning. The battery life is absolutely phenomenal compared to my Fire tablet.

I prefer it over the newest, largest Paperwhite.","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","(Editing to reflect most recent purchase)

I bought 2 more of these Kindles on Prime day, paying $65 each for them. I paid $80 for the first one of this model, which was also a sale price. (When I purchased the first one, I also purchased the newest version of the Paperwhite, which I find awkwardly designed to hold with one small hand. I named that one ""Skippy"" because of its tendency to jump more than one page at a time. It's a complaint found in many reviews of that model.)

I have several older Kindles which have gotten a lot of use. Over time, it seems that they don't hold a charge as long as they did when they were new. I paid extra for the formerly-free 3G capability, which is no longer supported. (I think Amazon should give people credit if they paid the extra $20 or $30 for that feature.)

This Kindle and the new Paperwhite use a USB-C charging cable, which I prefer because there's no ""upside down, try again"" issue. It sounds trivial, but it's a plus, imho. Now I won't have to use 2 different cables, depending on which Kindle I'm charging.

I use several Kindles at a time: One in my purse (or 2 if I'm traveling where recharging is not an option). And 3 ""scattered"" around the house so that a Kindle is always within reach. I've also purchased others which I've given to my kids, loaded with books I think they would enjoy.

I'm not sure what makes this model *not* a Paperwhite. It has the features I love/need/use the most (adjustable fonts, adjustable light, built-in dictionary, note-taking capability, etc.). The slight difference in weight is actually noticeable--and appreciated by my arthritic hands.

I always purchase a magnetic cover that allows the device to wake up automatically when it is opened. (If you purchase on ebay, you'll find covers that are a lot cheaper than identical covers sold on Amazon.)

My original review:

It seems as if ""they"" constantly try to convince us that our devices (cell phones, tvs, computers, watches) are outdated technology. Too small, too large, too ""flippy"". This Kindle is probably as small as I'd want to go. If I wanted a smaller screen than this Kindle, I'd just use my phone.

(The latest Paperwhite is noticeably larger than this device and previous Paperwhites. My preferred technique of holding it with one hand is more awkward with a larger device. It feels unbalanced, top-heavy. The cover is larger, too, of course, which adds more weight. I have arthritis in my hands, so it probably bothers me more than others. If I'm using a Kindle easel or holding it on my lap, it doesn't matter. But for one-handed Kindling, I like this little model. It's my new ""travel Kindle"".)

I miss and resent the loss of free X-G for the Kindles. I paid extra for free 3G on my previous Kindles and it's useless now. It's not a huge hardship, but I have to remember to sync my devices before I leave the house. It can be a nuisance to find my place in my ""purse Kindle"" when I'm not home. (And Amazon loses out on those impulse purchases that I used to make when I finished a book and felt an urgent need to buy the sequel or something by the same author.)

In conclusion, this is my new, preferred Kindle. My Kindle collection will now consiste of 3 of these, plus the larger Paperwhite I call ""Skippy"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","2","",""

In short, being able to carry my library literally in my pocket.

I’ve had several iterations of the e-ink kindles over the years, my least favorite being the popular paperwhite with which I’ve always encountered quality control issues and have always duly returned.

My favorite e-ink device for years was the kindle touch 4rth generation which looked better than any of the paperwhites I’ve ever come across with a rich text that made it pleasant to read, even though it has only 167 ppi. The Voyage with increased ppi replaced this, and I must confess that this had the best and richest contrast of a screen I’ve experienced ever. The Voyage truly makes look the paperwhites and some of the Oasis’ (not all) look blurry in comparison.

But with kindle basic, the richness of the text pops out from the screen and is a joy to hold, feeling even lighter and more portable than the Voyage. I hope amazon always keeps these nice smaller and lighter units, even if the device has to sacrifice the page turn buttons to do so.

I chose the denim, and truly love it. This reader seems to capture the best features of my previous kindles in terms of screen quality and size and portability.

I suspect that the rich screen contrast of this basic kindle is due in no small part to the lack of the waterproofing which adds another layer between the eye and the text (from what I have gathered in the forums).

Also, there is less lighting on this kindle. Personally, I would not have minded if they had done away built in light altogether and made a lighted case like they did with kindle touch. I did a comparison of the kindle touch with lighted cover alongside this kindle and the oasis with the warm light, and the kindle touch beat them all with maintaining clarity and crispness of of text. I don’t use the light much on the kindle, as I never seem to get the setting where I enjoy the clarity of the text. Using a reading light, like the ones you clip on a book, are much better imo. Thus, I don’t miss the warm light of the Oasis.

Suggestions to improve this kindle: Add the animated page turns, maybe a way to vertically scroll on the pages. I would also love a kindle home button like the kindle touch. But that’s it really.

Sidenote: In regard to waterproofing. Over the years, I’ve taken my non waterproof Voyage everywhere from beaches to swimming pools, and never experienced trouble, so if waterproofing really takes away from the quality of the screen, let the Oasis or paperwhite keep that market.

Additional sidenote: the kindle covers to this unit are reasonably priced and the blue cover matches the denim unit perfectly.

This kindle as a basic has just about everything I could wish for, namely in size and portability and clarity and contrast of text.","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

My wife is very sensitive to light in the bedroom though; she can tolerate my phone on lowest light and night setting but not the brightness of any book lights I've bought.  This is a perfect solution, and you can set it to dark mode such that the words are white and the page is black, which creates even less light overall and feels even easier on my eyes in the dark.

I also love the experimental browser.  I usually only read my news, not watch it, and I read from a lot of different sources.  Going to the news sites themselves is a lot for the browser, AP News can't ever load on mine while CNN generally can, but instead it works perfectly to Google the news source, go to the news tab where all of their articles will show up, click on what you want to read, and then go into articles mode.  It may seem like a mess to do, but the extra steps don't take long at all, and it's so much easier on my eyes to read articles on the Kindle as opposed to off of my phone.

I also love that you can access e-books from the public library on the Kindle.  You can find the e-book you want from your library, and it will take you to a link to rent it via Amazon so that it will appear on your Kindle and disappear when your check-in date comes.

THE BAD:
The only thing that I really hate, is the store. The store is incredibly slow and glitchy. It takes forever to get to the book you want just because it freezes and glitches so much. Once you’ve found the book you want, downloading the book is very fast and easy - sort of makes up for the store being terrible. I usually just stay in the book once I have it downloaded, until I finish the book - I don’t exit out of the book each time I’m done reading - just because I don’t want to deal with the store and the library each time.

THE GOOD:
Once you are in the book and reading it - it is amazing. It is so convenient and I love that there are so many customization options (fonts, font sizes, 25 brightness levels, etc). My absolute favorite thing about the kindle is that it literally stays charged forever. I read for about 2 or 3 hours every day. I received my kindle at the beginning of July, charged it fully at that time - and I haven’t charged it since (today is the 29th of July) - it’s still on 58% charge. It has truly shocked me how long this thing stays charged. I love it.

MIXED FEELINGS:
It takes some time to get used to. When you “turn it off” - the screen is darker but it stays on with recommendations of other books. I was honestly quite confused when the screen didn’t go black or “turn off” how normal phones or iPads do. This took some time to get used to and I’m still not sure how I feel about it. But overall, I really enjoy reading on my kindle - I just wish they would make the store and library a bit faster and less glitchy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

I find that most reviews of this line of readers almost always come from avid users of the brand who either are excited about certain improvements or angry that it's not what it used to be. I actually had one of those original ones with the keyboard and it was dead for a long time. I had a new battery put in, knowing that I could have bought a brand new one for the same price, and it was still dead. I think eventually the e-ink simply gives up and can't make an image. It's shame because those were pretty nice units. Before I bought this one on sale on Prime Day I read an excellent article about e-readers as a category, not just Kindles, and learned some solid truths that weren't written by a press agent. Once this model was introduced the more expensive ones really don't buy you much more in dollar value and some of the so called features can really work against you. There's no escaping it - to be able to just grab your Kindle anywhere at any time this model is all you need and easily the most convenient. The quirks? Sure we all know about them and after all these years and with all of the advances in technology they are massively overpriced and under engineered. But it is a continuous profit stream for them so why mess with it? At the sixty-four bucks I got this for it is only about three times overpriced, they should be going for no more than twenty five bucks and the accessories are through the roof as well. But if you really want to tote a couple of hundred books around with you and have them fit in your pocket, there is still nothing better than this basic model.

YES NO MAYBE

For the closing argument I gathered the three most often cited complaints, or negatives, about the basic Kindle and being an owner here's my opinion on them. No waterproofing (oh really, and just how many paper books have you read in the swimming pool?)  No color temperature adjustment (same question, when was the last time you read a paper book and changed the color of the page from white to orange?) And finally, raised bezel design (no really, this is among the top three complaints, I can't even come up with a comeback for that one, Virtually every TV and computer monitor screen has a bezel, why did it get to be a problem if your Kindle has one?

Stop reading other people's opinions and buy one and go sit under a tree and read an interesting book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

If you love reading just get one. It’s a good purchase and you can get thousands of books!! I have kindle unlimited and it’s the best. Even without it you can get books from you library and transfer them to your kindle for free!!

The back light is the best. It could be pitch black in my room and even with my kindle brightness all the way down I can still see just fine. Sometimes it’s brighter than I need it to be but it’s the best.
Again, If you love reading, get a kindle. It’s a good investment and cheaper in the long run if you always buy physical books!!

The battery life is amazing. I charged it one time and it lasted a whole week. It’s small enough to fit in my hand but big enough to read","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

Lately, my aging eyes have found the print on the phone screen too small, and my hands and arms have found the tablet tiring to hold.  As a result, my reading sessions were getting shorter and shorter.  When Prime Day rolled around, I took advantage of the bargain price to purchase a basic Kindle.  The e-ink screen is easy on my eyes, and the device’s light weight makes it comfortable for me to hold, especially since I have very small hands.  Set-up was a cinch.  Perhaps because of long experience with e-reading apps, I found customizing fonts and layout easy and tapping to turn pages second nature.  Thanks to the Kindle, I am reading much more again, and that makes me happy since I’ve been a voracious reader all my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

Not very laggy and does everything every other kindle does so unless you plan on reading under water this does pretty much what paper white can do for cheaper.

Small and sleek at 6"", it delivers a lot.  Over the pandemic my Kindle Keyboard and Amazon Fire Tablet both stopped working due to dead batteries.  I had initially investigated replacing the batteries but then decided to get myself a new Kindle because I missed my e-reader experience.  I did a lot of research, watched a lot of videos and read a lot of reviews before making this purchase.  I was always impressed with the anti-glare screen of the Kindle Keyboard and wanted something similar.  Since I was familiar with the user interface for the Fire Tablet, I did not want a device that would hamper my reading due to the glossy finish, glare and reflection.  What sold me on the Kindle Basic (2022) was the size, the storage and the display.  It made perfect sense for me to get a replacement that I am able to carry around.  It fits nicely into a pocket or purse and is extremely light.  I was lucky to take advantage of Prime Day and got it at a steal of a deal.  It was delivered in 3 days!  I would highly recommend getting a case with the device for added protection.  The case shown in the pics was also purchased on Amazon.  If you are on the fence about this, stop hesitating and get it without delay!","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

Charged from 50% out of the box to full in maybe 15 minutes; the backlight will obviously drain it significantly faster, but with the backlight off I went through an entire chapter and it didn’t go down at all. The backlight goes from imperceptible glow at 1 to obnoxiously bright at max; there’s basically no reason to get a paper white anymore unless you just want the waterproof body and a slightly bigger screen, but it’s obviously heavier too. The 300 ppi screen is phenomenal, I couldn’t even notice any pixelation with a magnifying glass; it looks and almost kind of feels like paper. I’ve used older kindles in the past but this is the first one I’ve actually purchased. Even with the textured body and matte screen this thing seems to absorb fingerprints like a sponge, but they’re not noticeable in dim/low light, but it looks like my toddler was playing with it in full lighting. It wipes down clean easily with a dry cloth though; I just hate having smudges on things, but this is going to be in your hands, so it’s inevitably going to have them. I ordered a grip that attaches to the top/bottom or any of the corners so I can hold it lying on my back easier but it hasn’t arrived yet; no hand fatigue holding it as is since it’s so lightweight, but I don’t like getting hit in the face with things in my hand if I nod off. Overall 5/5 I’d recommend it to anyone looking for an e-reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","3","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2"

So when it came time to trade in I went paper white over Fire. The battery is absolutely phenomenal & if it's just for reading the thin, slim 6 inch size is absolutely perfect. The 10 inch Fire is great if you want it for media too, like movies & such. The 8 inch I thought would make a difference to me but I'm way happier with the smaller size for travel & holding it. The back light is wonderful with dark & light modes & adjustable brightness for both, making reading at night easy.

The huge take aways for me: super light, easy to hold & easy to carry. It's not too much for an e-reader where-as the Fire was a bit much. I only ever used it to read. I've had issues switching to an e-device for reading & the paper white has helped me ignore it's not a book.

Wonderful device","Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023","I honestly love my kindle! I opted for the basic one as I do not need all the bells and whistles, I'm more of a passive reader. I also got the three months free of Kindle Unlimited, it's opened me up to more genres and authors.

Now, about the kindle. It's so straight forward it's insane. The simplicity is what's most charming about it. The display is to die for, it feels like reading a real book. Perfect for travel, it's compact and light. And you can decorate it! I think that's the most fun part. Cases, popsockets, stickers. The works.

All in all, it is a very useful gadget. If you read a lot, you can have all of your books at your fingertips and it won't make your bag anymore heavier. If you're a passive reader like me, it can motivate you to read more! It's cute too! I would say to wait for a sale, I got mine on prime day. Also take a look at the other models (there's a model for note-takers, bathtub readers...). But definitely look into it, read more reviews, and do your research!

My second one -- a paperwhite I think -- lasted over ten years (and was still lasting, I just decided it was time to upgrade), so I was confident that getting another one would probably give me another decade of solid reading performance. And again, the Kindle just impresses. I went with this one instead of the newer paperwhites because of two reasons: first of all, I actually like the size of this one compared to the paperwhite. The small form factor is perfect; it's easy to carry around and travel with, whether in a suitcase or a pocket, and it's comfortable to hold and read on for hours at a time. The second reason was for the matte finish. I can't stand fingerprints and smudges on my devices, and that really turned me off of getting the paperwhite. People say that this one doesn't feel as premium without the flush face, but I disagree. This Kindle version DOES feel premium, but in a simplistic and minimal way -- that doesn't get fingerprints all over it! If you're concerned at all about the smaller size compared to the paperwhite, don't be. If I had to choose between the two tomorrow, I'd go with this one again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","4","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/product-reviews/B0B92489PD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3"

But I am very happy with it, you can turn off the backlight and see the words perfectly in full sunlight or in a regularly lit room, so its obviously the same technology as the earlier kindle screens.

As others have mentioned, I wouldn't bother paying extra for the ""ad free"" version. The ads are only shown when its locked. Battery lasts forever, even when reading with the backlight.

You can plug it into your computer with the USB cable and it shows up like a jump drive, so you can directly copy .AZW files onto it. Haven't tried .mobi or .epub files yet, but even if they won't work directly Calibre can seamlessly convert them to AZW format.

It’s great! I described it to my coworkers as being fun! I love the way it feels in my hand so small and lightweight! The screen is enjoyable to read off of and I just love that I can see definition for words and I can be reminded who characters are! I really think this is going to take my reading game to the next level! Sounds silly and everyone says it, but I think I read faster. Plus I love that I can use the Libby app!

The battery seems to last a while, honestly haven’t charged it since I started using it. The ads only play on the Lock Screen so no pop ups while you’re reading.

What I don't like is the swiping. Left and right for the pages, down from the top for one menu and up from the bottom for another, but worse is the tap on the top for another menu.

A bonus is the text to speech, First off, it doesn't freak out when jostled like the fire tablets. But it's blue tooth only, it has NO speakers. But was really sucks about it, it is hard, VERY hard to control. It takes patience and finesse to set it up into text-to-speech mode, and even more to get it back into regular reader mode, because of this, I will have to keep using the fire tablets for that option.

August 1, 2023, update:
Not even a month in and I've already had to charge it three times, once when I got it, a weekish and a half ago, and it's sitting on the charger right now. I'm only using it for about an average of an hour a day, (bedtime reading), and the light isn't full blast. I'm lucky if it makes it for 2 weeks let alone the 6 weeks they bragged about.
